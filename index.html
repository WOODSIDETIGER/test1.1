      <p class="greeting"> 
        Thank you for visiting this space! This site was created as part of my journey to learn and practice HTML, the building block of the web. What you’re looking at right now isn’t just text, colors, and links—it’s the result of coding line by line, experimenting, fixing mistakes, and slowly shaping ideas into something real on your screen.
        This project is more than an assignment—it’s my first step into the world of web development. Through building this site, I’ve learned how HTML works, how tags structure content, and how CSS makes everything come alive with style. Every heading, paragraph, and image you see here is a reminder that small pieces of code can come together to create something meaningful.
        I hope as you browse through these pages, you’ll not only see the project itself but also feel the process behind it—the late-night debugging, the “aha!” moments when something finally works, and the fun of experimenting with new designs. Learning web development is a journey, and this project is my starting milestone. 
        So take your time, click around, and explore what’s here. If you’re also learning HTML, maybe you’ll find inspiration or tips along the way. And if you’re just curious, enjoy the experience of seeing a beginner’s project evolve. 
        Thanks again for stopping by—I’m glad you’re here to share this small but exciting part of my coding adventure! 🚀
